# Manually Syncing the Forked Repository

To manually sync the forked repository with the upstream repository, follow these steps:

1. Open the forked repository in your GitHub account.
2. Go to the "Actions" tab in the repository.
3. Click on the "Workflows" option in the sidebar.
4. Find the workflow file named `sync.yml` and click on it.
5. Click on the "Run workflow" button.
6. Select the branch you want to sync with the upstream repository (e.g., `main`).
7. Click on the "Run workflow" button to start the synchronization process.
8. Wait for the workflow to complete. It will automatically sync the forked repository with the upstream repository.
9. Once the synchronization is complete, your forked repository will be up to date with the latest changes from the upstream repository.

Note: If you encounter any conflicts during the synchronization process, you will need to resolve them manually. Refer to the GitHub documentation on how to resolve merge conflicts.

That's it! Your forked repository is now synced with the upstream repository.
